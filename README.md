# Online Store Desktop Application
This is a desktop application built with Java and the javax.swing (Swing) library that simulates an online store. The application allows users to browse through products and add them to a shopping cart. Once the user is ready to checkout, the selected items and the total cost are saved into a text file.

The application provides a user-friendly interface to enhance the customer experience. Users can easily navigate through the store, view product details, and add items to their cart

This project is a great example of using Java Swing to create a desktop application. It demonstrates the use of various Swing components, such as buttons, labels, and text fields, to create a visually appealing and functional application.
